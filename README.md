# Django Realtime Group Chat App

# Important

Note: While this chat app is still functional, I recommend checking out my newest chat app built using express.js, node.js, and socket.io for a more advanced experience. My new app includes more features and a cleaner user interface. You can find my new group chat app at https://github.com/andyzhp234/QuickChat.

I've decided to keep this project available on GitHub as a reference and for posterity. It serves as a record of my earlier work and shows how my development skills have evolved over time. If you're interested in learning more about our chat app development process, or want to see how we've improved over time, we encourage you to check out my newest project.

Thank you for taking the time to visit this GitHub repository.
