# Django Realtime Group Chat App

# Important

Note: While this chat app is still functional, I recommend checking out my newest chat app built using express.js, node.js, and socket.io for a more advanced experience. My new app includes more features and a cleaner user interface. You can find my new group chat app at https://github.com/andyzhp234/QuickChat.
